This folder contains various KDE Plasma configuration items. Some are my own, and some I just have stashed here in case I ever need to find them again.

- `color-schemes` - Color schemes. To use these, move contents to `~/.local/share/color-schemes/` and select desired color scheme in Sysetm Settings.
    - Breeze Black - A very black version of the Breeze color scheme. I downloaded this one.
    - Breeze Darker - A darker vesion of the Breeze Dark color scheme. I made this one by adjusting Breeze Dark.
